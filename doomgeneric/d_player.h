#ifndef __D_PLAYER__
#define __D_PLAYER__


// The player data structure depends on a number
// of other structs: items (internal inventory),
// animation states (closely tied to the sprites
// used to represent them, unfortunately).
#include "d_items.h"
#include "p_pspr.h"

// In addition, the player is just a special
// case of the generic moving object/actor.
#include "p_mobj.h"

// Finally, for odd reasons, the player input
// is buffered within the player data struct,
// as commands per game tick.
#include "d_ticcmd.h"

#include "net_defs.h"
